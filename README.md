# LibraryWebApp

This is a sample web app for demonstrative purposes using ASP.net Core 2.1 to showcase how to implement EntityFrameWork as an ORM into an MVC pattern web app and how to use various forms of business logic to manipulate data entities from a database.

The sample project is for a fictional library system, it allows the client to view a catalog of library assets, and check-in/check-out assets as well as place them on hold. The system also allows the client to view all active members and library branches and their respective details.

In order to replicate project data:
--add migration to your default localDb using SQL Server
--run the SQL script attached in the repository in SQL Server
